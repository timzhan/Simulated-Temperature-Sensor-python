# Readme

On Azure Marketplace, there is a module called [`Simulated Temperature Sensor`]((https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-iot.simulated-temperature-sensor?tab=Overview)) which is a great module for new Azure IoT Edge developers to start with.

However, this app is developed in C#. Apparently some developers are not C# fans and are looking for a Python version. I created it here for their reference.

**PLEASE BE NOTED**: this sample module and the source codes are created for **testing purpose** or **learnign purpsoe** only. Neither the coding style nor the use of connection_strings instead of certificates is recommended for production codes.
